# opengl-cge
OpenGL C++ game engine for educational purposes

# The goal
I'll use this repository to control and share my progress on my understanding of opengl. I'll test my knowledge by building a engine which will only serve as educational purposes.

# Building
I still have to look into that.
The project currently uses Visual Studio 2015 and opengl 4.3
